>As it grows bigger and bigger<br>
>The world around it<br>
>Which once seemed endless<br>
>Begins to press closer.<br>
>
>The sky lowers.br>
>The ground hardens.<br>
>And the roots learn<br>
>That there is an edge.<br>
>
>At first the container feels infinite.<br>
>Open.<br>
>Forgiving.<br>
>A place where anything is possible.<br>
>
>But slowly,<br>
>Very slowly,<br>
>It becomes clear:<br>
>That nothing here is accidental<br>
>
>Every cut matters.<br>
>Every wire leaves a memory.<br>
>And the freedom it thought it had<br>
>Turns into direction.<br>
>
>And the old masters say:<br>
>That the first pruning is violent.<br>
>So abrupt.<br>
>That the tree must think:<br>
>“Is this the end?”<br>
>“Is this where I disappear?”<br>
>
>But then it pushes a new bud.<br>
>Somewhere unexpected.<br>
>And it’s surprised.<br>
>
>Because it isn’t dying,<br>
>It’s being revealed.<br>
>
>And what was once wild and formless,<br>
>Begins to understand itself<br>
>
>Not as a forest.<br>
>Not as a tree among others.<br>
>But as one life!<br>
>Contained.<br>
>Intentional.<br>
>
>And this narrowing world,<br>
>Which felt like loss<br>
>Becomes clarity.<br>
>
>And this small space<br>
>Which once felt like a cage,<br>
>Becomes Home.<br>
>
>Because bonsai is not about making a tree smaller.<br>
>It’s about teaching it<br>
>How to be infinite<br>
>In a quiet place.<br>
